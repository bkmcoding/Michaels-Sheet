## About The Project

**Michael's Sheets** is a dedicated educational repository designed to consolidate study materials. It serves as a central point for accessing lecture notes, algorithm breakdowns, and mathematical formulas.

Whether you need a quick refresh on **Big O notation** or a deep dive into **Vector Calculus**, the resources are organized for quick access.

*Hosted on Azure SWA services & Cloudflare R2 Storage*

<br>

## Course Catalog

The hub currently supports resources for the following coursework:

| Class Code | Course Name | Focus Areas |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CS 2114** | **Data Structures** | Algorithms, trees, graphs, and complexity analysis. |
| **CS 3203** | **Machine Learning** | Neural networks, optimization, and model evaluation frameworks. |
| **MATH 3003** | **Linear Algebra** | Vector spaces, transformations, eigenvalues, and matrix operations. |
| **CS 2413** | **Cybersecurity** | Network security, cryptography, penetration testing, and threat analysis. |
| **MATH 3404** | **Calculus III** | Multivariable calculus, partial derivatives, and vector calculus. |

<br>

## More to come

This is essentially a base project just to store some guides and practice sheets.

I plan to add the ability to upload coursework/material and it will be automatically
consolidated, formatted, summarized into a PDF.

If successful I also hope to add the ability to produce practice problems for studying based
off the material the user has chose.
